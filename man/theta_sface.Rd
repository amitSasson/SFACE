\arguments{
\item{y}{The categorical outcome vector of length n.  Must be encoded o for disease-free, 1 for the first subtype and 2 for the second subtype.}

\item{A}{The treatment/expousre vector pf length n. Must be encoded 1 for treated and 0 for untreated.}

\item{X}{The n Ã— p-matrix of covariates X, Default: NULL}

\item{scale}{Indication of weather the SF-ACE should be estimated on the difference or risk ratio scale.}

\item{method}{Indication of which method to use when adjusting for covariates, possibilities inclued standardization ("stand"), Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting ("IPTW"), and doubly robust estimation ("DR")}

\item{lambda1}{sensitivity parameter for subtype 1. Can range between 0 (S-Monotonicity for subtype 1) and 1 (D-Monotonicity for subtype 1), Default: 0}

\item{lambda2}{sensitivity parameter for subtype 2. Can range between 0 (S-Monotonicity for subtype 2) and 1 (D-Monotonicity for subtype 2), Default: 0}

\item{weight}{A vector of length n, holding weights to adjust for missing subtypes, Default: 1}

\item{MultPer}{A numeric value indicating per how many people the effect sould be calculated on the difference scale, Default: 1}
