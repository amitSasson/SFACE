\arguments{
\item{stand_formula}{A formula for standartization and DR, y ~ A + X, the outcome as a function of the exposure and covariates}

\item{iptw_formula}{A formula for IPTW and DR, A ~ X, the exposure as a function of the covariates.}

\item{exposure}{The treatment/exposure vector pf length n. Must be encoded 1 for treated and 0 for untreated.}

\item{outcome}{The categorical outcome vector of length n.  Must be encoded 0 for disease-free, 1 for the first subtype and 2 for the second subtype.}

\item{df}{a data frame with columns for the outcome, expousre and covariates.}

\item{subtype}{Should the SF-ACE be estimated for subtype 1 or subtype 2}

\item{scale}{Should the SF-ACE be estimated on the difference or risk ratio scale.}

\item{method}{Which method to use when adjusting for covariates, possibilities include standardization ("stand"), Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting ("IPTW"), and doubly robust estimation ("DR")}

\item{lambda1}{sensitivity parameter for subtype 1. Can range between 0 (S-Monotonicity for subtype 1) and 1 (D-Monotonicity for subtype 1), Default: 0}

\item{lambda2}{sensitivity parameter for subtype 2. Can range between 0 (S-Monotonicity for subtype 2) and 1 (D-Monotonicity for subtype 2), Default: 0}

\item{weight}{A numerical vector of length n, holding weights to adjust for missing subtypes, Default: 1}

\item{MultPer}{A numeric value indicating per how many people the effect should be calculated on the difference scale, Default: 1}
